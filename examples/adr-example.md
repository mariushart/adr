# Adopt Event Sourcing for Order Processing

## Metadata
- ID: ADR-042
- Type: ADR
- Status: Proposed
- Date: 2025-01-20
- Deciders: Jane Smith (Tech Lead), John Doe (Architecture)

## Relationships
### Dependencies
- Requires: ADR-038 (Message Broker) - Required for event distribution and processing
- Influences: ADR-045 (Database Selection) - Constrains choices to event store capable DBs
- Enables: ADR-046 (CQRS Implementation) - Provides event stream for read models
- Conflicts: ADR-036 (Transactional Approach) - Incompatible with current ACID requirements
- Supersedes: ADR-028 (Direct Database Updates) - Replaces synchronous update pattern

### Impact Analysis
- Strength: High
- Scope: Order Processing, Data Storage, System Integration
- Reversibility: Low
- Technical Debt: Medium

## Context
Our current order processing system uses direct database updates, leading to data consistency issues across microservices and difficulties in tracking order state changes. We need a more robust approach to handle our growing order volume and audit requirements.

## Decision Story
- In the context of: increasing order volumes and audit requirements
- Facing concern(s): 
  - Data consistency issues across services
  - Lack of audit trail for order changes
  - Difficulty in debugging order processing issues
- We decided: to implement event sourcing for order processing
- And not: 
  - Continue with direct database updates
  - Implement distributed transactions
  - Use LLT pattern with compensating transactions
- To achieve: 
  - Complete audit trail of all order changes
  - Ability to reconstruct order state at any point in time
  - Better debugging and system observability
- Accepting: 
  - Increased initial development complexity
  - Need for team training on event sourcing patterns
  - Additional infrastructure requirements

## Decision
We will implement event sourcing for the order processing system, storing all order-related events in an event store and deriving order state from the event stream.

## Rationale
- Chosen because:
  - Provides complete audit trail by design
  - Enables replay of events for debugging
  - Supports future business intelligence needs
  - Aligns with our microservices architecture
- Alternatives considered:
  - Distributed transactions: Rejected due to scaling limitations
  - Saga pattern: Too complex for our current needs
  - Status tracking table: Wouldn't solve audit requirements

## Consequences
- Positive:
  - Complete history of all order changes
  - Improved debugging capabilities
  - Better scalability
  - Enhanced audit compliance
- Negative:
  - Higher initial development effort
  - Learning curve for team
  - More complex querying for simple cases
- Risks:
  - Team unfamiliarity with pattern
  - Event schema evolution challenges
  - Potential event store performance impacts

## Technical Details
- Event Store Requirements:
  - Must support optimistic concurrency
  - Need for event schema versioning
  - Stream aggregation capabilities
  - Projection support
- Key Events:
  - OrderCreated
  - OrderItemAdded
  - OrderPriceCalculated
  - OrderConfirmed
  - OrderShipped
