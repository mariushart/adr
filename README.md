## Overview

This repository provides a standardized approach to documenting architectural decisions through ADRs. It includes templates, examples, and tools that support both individual project decisions and enterprise-wide architectural governance.

## Visual Dependency Graph

This graph represents the dependencies between the ADRs using Mermaid. Each ADR is represented as a node, and dependencies are represented as directed edges between nodes.

```mermaid

    ADR-001[Need for ADR] --> ADR-002[Template Structure]
    ADR-002 --> ADR-003[Metadata Fields]
    ADR-002 --> ADR-004[Impact Analysis]
    ADR-001 --> ADR-005[ADR Versioning]
    ADR-005 --> ADR-006[Enterprise-wide ADR Management]
    ADR-006 --> ADR-007[Automated EA Monitoring]

## Getting Started

1. **New to ADRs?**
   - Read [ADR-001](docs/adr/adr-001-need-for-adr.md) for background
   - Review the [example ADR](examples/adr_example.md)
   - Check the [glossary](docs/glossary.md) for terminology

2. **Creating ADRs**
   - Copy [full template](templates/full.md) to your project
   - Follow the template structure
   - Use consistent naming: `adr-NNN-title.md`

3. **Project Integration**
   ```bash
   # Create ADR directory in your project
   mkdir -p docs/adr
   
   # Copy template and tools
   cp templates/full.md docs/adr/adr-template.md
   cp -r tools/validators .
   ```

## Framework Features

- **Standardized Format**: Consistent, machine-readable ADR structure
- **Enterprise Support**: Tools and formats for EA oversight
- **Version Control**: Clear strategy for managing ADR lifecycles
- **Impact Analysis**: Framework for assessing architectural impacts
- **Automation Ready**: Support for automated monitoring and analysis

## Usage Guidelines

### Individual Projects
