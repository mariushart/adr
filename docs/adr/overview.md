# ADR Overview

## Visual Dependency Graph

This graph represents the dependencies between the ADRs using Mermaid. Each ADR is represented as a node, and dependencies are represented as directed edges between nodes.

```mermaid
graph TD
    ADR-001[Need for ADR] --> ADR-002[Template Structure]
    ADR-002 --> ADR-003[Metadata Fields]
    ADR-002 --> ADR-004[Impact Analysis]
    ADR-001 --> ADR-005[ADR Versioning]
    ADR-005 --> ADR-006[Enterprise-wide ADR Management]
    ADR-006 --> ADR-007[Automated EA Monitoring]
```

## Purpose

The purpose of this graph is to provide a visual representation of how the ADRs are interconnected. It helps in understanding the dependencies and relationships between different ADRs, making it easier to navigate and comprehend the overall architecture decision process.
